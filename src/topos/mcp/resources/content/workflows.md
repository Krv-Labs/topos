# Topos Agent Workflows

Per CodeScene's 2026 best-practice research ("agent-first tools need
AGENTS.md-style orchestration"), this document is the canonical recipe for
using Topos tools in a closed-loop refactor. Agents should read this on
first encounter with the server.

## The canonical loop: review → plan → refactor → re-measure

```

### 1. Measure

- Single file: `topos_evaluate_file(filepath, gitnexus_dir)` — REQUIRES
  `gitnexus_dir` for coupling. Without it, COMPOSABLE/SOUND cannot happen.
- Whole project: `topos_evaluate_project(path, gitnexus_dir)` — rollup +
  worst-N file list. Start here to pick a target.

### 2. Plan

Read the `guidance` field of the evaluation result. It's priority-aware and
tells you which dimension to work on. If `guidance` says "provide
gitnexus_dir" you must run `topos depgraph generate` first.

For deep analysis of a specific file, call `topos_inspect_code` — it returns
top-N functions by complexity, entropy details, and the full metric table.

### 3. Propose

Write a refactor. Keep the change focused on one dimension at a time.
Submit via `topos_assess_improvement(filepath=..., proposed_code=...)`.

### 4. Verify

`topos_assess_improvement` returns one of:

- `IMPROVEMENT` — lattice moved up (e.g. BROKEN → SELF_CONTAINED). Commit.
- `IMPROVEMENT_SCORE` — lattice unchanged but per-dim scores improved.
  Progress, but not a verdict jump yet.
- `LATERAL_MOVE` — neither improved nor regressed. Try a different angle.
- `REGRESSION` / `REGRESSION_SCORE` — revert and re-plan.
- **`SUSPICIOUS_NO_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE`** — ⚠️ scores moved but AST barely
  changed. The refactor is probably cosmetic (whitespace / comments /
  renames). Make a structural change, not a textual one. **Do not commit.**

### 5. Decide

Stop when:
- Status = `SOUND` (both targets achieved), OR
- Priority-specific target reached (`self_contained` → SELF_CONTAINED,
  `composable` → COMPOSABLE), OR
- `max_iterations` exhausted — report partial progress honestly rather than
  gaming one more iteration.

## Escape hatches — when the loop stalls

### Stall #1: Both dimensions plateau below 60%

Often a sign the file needs to be **split**, not refactored. Use
`topos_inspect_code` to find the top-complexity functions; consider
extracting them into a separate module. Re-run `topos_evaluate_project` to
check the rollup doesn't regress as a result.

### Stall #2: `SUSPICIOUS_NO_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE` repeatedly

You're iterating on presentation. Step back: what is the *structural*
problem? Rename → not a refactor. Whitespace → not a refactor. Loop
unrolling, extracted helpers, collapsed conditionals → real refactors.

### Stall #3: Structural improves, coupling regresses

Classic "moved complexity elsewhere" anti-pattern. Re-run
`topos_evaluate_project` — did the other file's score drop? If so, the
refactor didn't reduce total system complexity, it just relocated it.
Consider if the abstraction is actually an improvement or just a shuffle.

## Priority selection cheat sheet

- Leaf module (few callers) → `self_contained`
- Library surface (many importers) → `composable`
- Unknown / general cleanup → `balanced`

See `topos://docs/priority` for more.

## What Topos does NOT measure

- **Test coverage.** A refactor that improves the score but breaks tests
  is a regression. Topos cannot see this; run the test suite separately.
- **Functional correctness.** AST edit distance measures *change*, not
  *preservation of behavior*. Always verify behavior with tests.
- **Runtime performance.** Orthogonal to all Topos metrics.
- **Security.** Separate concern.

Topos is one signal in a multi-signal loop. Pair it with test coverage and
type checks for the full picture.
