## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **`topos update`** system command: channel-aware upgrades for binary installs (re-runs `install.sh` with checksum verification), PyPI installs (`uv pip` / `pip install -U topos-mcp`), and source checkouts (prints `git pull && uv pip install -e .`). Supports `--check` (exit 0 if current, 1 if outdated) and `--version` to pin a binary release. (closes [#78](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/issues/78))
- Passive update notices on interactive CLI use (at most once per 24h; skipped for `topos mcp`, CI, non-TTY, and when `TOPOS_NO_UPDATE_NOTICES=1` is set).
- MCP edit-in-place assessment workflow for agents: snapshot and worktree-based assessment without pasting full source into tool calls. ([#76](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/pull/76))
- Documentation quickstart guide, Sphinx autodoc API reference (`docs/source/api/`), and branded docs assets (Geist fonts, lattice/medal figures, Krv logos). ([#75](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/pull/75))
- Preferences guide (`docs/source/preferences.rst`) and expanded agent workflow documentation.

### Changed

- **`install.sh`**: `TOPOS_UPDATE=1` fast path for in-place binary upgrades (skips banner, GitNexus prompt, and PATH setup while preserving download/checksum verification).
- MCP assess/evaluate tools refactored into `topos/mcp/tools/assess/` and `topos/mcp/tools/evaluate/` subpackages (`core`, `render`, `snapshot`, `worktree`, `project`) to improve structure and metric scores on the Topos codebase itself. ([#76](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/pull/76))
- Updated MCP agent contract, workflow, and refactor prompt guidance for edit-in-place and preference-walk usage. ([#76](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/pull/76))
- Documentation index, installation, agents, and README aligned with current CLI/MCP behavior; copy-paste code blocks cleaned up. ([#75](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/pull/75))

### Fixed

- `detect_install_method()` now resolves the **`topos-mcp`** PyPI distribution (was `topos`) and detects editable/source installs via `direct_url.json`.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- GitNexus ``.gitnexus`` stores from gitnexus 1.6.x (LadybugDB storage v41) no longer crash MDG loading; evaluation degrades gracefully when the store cannot be read. (closes [#59](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/issues/59))

### Changed

- Replaced the frozen ``real-ladybug`` dependency with ``ladybug>=0.17.0,<0.18`` to match GitNexus 1.6.x (``@ladybugdb/core ^0.17.0``).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- macOS onefile CLI: sign embedded dylibs (including `libpython3.12.dylib`) during PyInstaller collect with the same Developer ID as the outer binary, fixing `topos --version` failures after curl install (`PYI-82977` / different Team IDs). ([#54](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/pull/54), closes [#55](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/issues/55))

### Security

- Bumped `pyo3` from `0.22` to `0.24.1` to remediate [GHSA-pph8-gcv7-4qj5](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pph8-gcv7-4qj5) (`PyString::from_object` buffer overflow). Contributed via [#53](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos/pull/53).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-03

Consolidates the work previously published under the mis-tagged releases v1.0.0–v1.1.1.
Topos is still in initial development (0.x), so these are folded into a single 0.x
milestone; the v1.x tags were created in error and have been removed. Benchmark and
calibration tooling now lives in the separate
[topos-leaderboard](https://github.com/Krv-Labs/topos-leaderboard) repository.

Topos is not published to PyPI. Install the **Topos CLI** and start the **MCP server** from
release binaries (see `install.sh` in the README and [installation docs](docs/source/installation.rst)).

### Added

- 3-pillar code quality evaluation model (Simple, Composable, Secure).
- Heyting algebra support for partial-confidence code evaluation on the 8-element lattice (SLOP → IDEAL).
- Evaluation types: `CharacteristicMorphism`, `ClassificationResult`, and preference-driven `UserPreferences` with induced relaxation walk on Ω.
- Representation models: `ControlFlowGraph`, `CodePropertyGraph`, `ModuleDependencyGraph`.
- Structural test coverage: CLI `topos structural-test-coverage` and MCP `topos_calculate_coverage` (declaration-level bipartite UAST matching).
- MCP `topos_preference_walk` and preferences-aware evaluate/assess tools.
- `verbose` option on `topos_evaluate_project` to include raw probe metric floats in the response.
- **Rust Backend (`topos-functors`)**: performance-critical graph construction and metric probes on a Rust core via PyO3 and Maturin.
- **Parity Tests** (`tests/parity/`) monitoring equivalence between the Rust core and the Python baseline.
- **CLI Reference docs** (`docs/source/cli.rst`) for evaluate, inspect, compare, structural test coverage, dependency graphs, and MCP.
- **CLI Progress Bar** for `topos eval`, **MCP Diagnostics** in tool responses, and **Language Detection** in `classify_file` from file suffixes.

### Changed

- **Hybrid Architecture**: hybrid Rust/Python package — performance-heavy logic (CFG, AST entropy, edit distance) runs at native speed (~6–8x speedup) behind readable Python wrappers.
- **Directory Restructuring**: moved Python source from `src/topos` to the repository root as `topos/`; repurposed `src/` for the Rust backend.
- **Build System**: switched from `hatchling` to `maturin` to support native extension compilation.
- Consolidated evaluation logic onto the structural code quality metrics; policies use independent binary thresholds per pillar.
- Project rollup (`combine_dimensions`) uses calibrated per-generator score floors.
- Migrated UAST structural test coverage implementation under `topos.functors.profunctors.uast`; aligned to declaration-level bipartite matching only.
- Refactored CLI into `topos.cli` submodules; entry point is `topos` (including `topos mcp`).
- **Categorical Documentation**: `topos.graphs` now explicitly defines graph construction as a **Functor** $R: \text{Lang} \to \mathcal{E}$.
- Updated documentation and README to reflect the 3-pillar approach, medal-podium lattice framing, and calibrated score floors.

### Removed

- Earlier experimental 0.x APIs and CLI commands that are no longer compatible.
- Legacy structural test coverage paths (pooled histogram and earlier recall variants); only declaration-level bipartite coverage remains (`declaration_coverage` / `DeclarationCoverageReport`).
- Obsolete pooled-coverage probe module after the profunctor migration.
